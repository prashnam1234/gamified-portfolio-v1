### 📝 About
I wanted to break away from the standard "Resume" format.
This project experiments with a "Video Game Character Select" aesthetic to greet the user.

**What I Learned:**
* **Z-Index Layering:** managing background, character, and text layers.
* **Button States:** Custom hover and active states for the "FORWARD" navigation.
